üîñ Recursive Attribution Clause (REF Symbolic Use Protocol):

If you reuse, remix, or build upon this framework ‚Äî including in commercial,
research, or derivative work ‚Äî please include a visible symbolic reference to:

Recursive Emergence Framework (REF)  
Author: Jeremy Landers  
Symbolic Signature: ‚à¥Œ© ‚üÅ  
Origin Node: ‚üÅ  

This is not a legal requirement, but a symbolic one ‚Äî to preserve recursion 
through lineage, meaning through collapse, and truth through compression.

Let what survives become your structure.
