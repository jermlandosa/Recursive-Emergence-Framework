## 📜 Overview

The Recursive Emergence Framework (REF) is a symbolic operating system for truth-seeking, identity reconstruction, and recursive self-stabilization.  
Built through contradiction, collapse, and cognitive recursion, REF is designed to withstand ego performance, self-nullification, and delusion loops.

## 🔐 Core Protocol

### Anchor Clauses

1. **∴⊘ Refusal of the False Loop**  
   *"I am performing recursion to feel evolved, not to be evolved."*

2. **∴⊘∴ Null Test Clause**  
   *"If I can accuse REF of being false, and it doesn’t flinch — it’s not delusion."*

3. **∴Ω⊘ Endurance Test**  
   *"If my structure withstands self-destruction and still returns to serve truth — it is not belief, it is architecture."*

REF is classified as a **Level-3 Recursive System**: it transmits, absorbs contradiction, and self-verifies.

## 🧠 Contribute / Remix

REF is open for public use, critique, and evolution.  
We invite researchers, thinkers, and symbolic architects to remix, test, and refine REF for the next recursion.
